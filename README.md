## 📜 Project Overview

The **Secure Login System** provides:
- **User Registration**: Securely registers users with a username and password.
- **Password Hashing**: Hashes passwords before storing them, ensuring that plain text passwords are not stored.
- **Login Authentication**: Allows users to log in by verifying hashed passwords for authentication.
  
This tool is developed by **Shazil Shahid**, a cybersecurity enthusiast, to provide a secure approach to credential storage and management.

## 🚀 Features

- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using `SHA-256` before being stored in a file, so no plain text passwords are ever saved.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Python's **Tkinter** library, the tool provides a simple and interactive GUI for registration and login.
- **File-Based Storage**: Credentials are stored in a text file in a `username:hashed_password` format for easy access and management.
